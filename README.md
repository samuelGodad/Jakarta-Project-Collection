# Online Registration System

## Overview

Create a web-based registration system using JSP,CSS,JS and Servlets. The system allows users to register by filling out a form and stores the submitted data in a simple database or file system.

## Functionalities

1. **Registration Form**: Develop a form using JSP where users can input their details like name, email, and password.
2. **Servlet Handling**: Use a Servlet to handle form submissions. Retrieve the form data from the request, validate it (e.g., check for empty fields), and store it in a simple data storage (could be an array, file, or database depending on your setup).
3. **Confirmation Page**: After successful registration, show a confirmation page or message to users confirming their registration.
4. **Login Page**: Create a basic login page using JSP and Servlets. Allow registered users to log in with their credentials.
5. **Improvisation Potential**: This basic setup can be expanded by adding features like user authentication, enhancing the registration form with more fields, implementing user sessions, or improving data storage to a database for better scalability.
